# Loan_Approval_Prediction_ML
Machine learning project for predicting loan approval status using Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest models with feature engineering, scaling, and model comparison.

# ðŸ’³ Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a loan application will be **approved or rejected** based on applicant details and financial information.  
It applies **Decision Tree**, **Naive Bayes**, and **Random Forest** classifiers to perform prediction and compares their performance.
